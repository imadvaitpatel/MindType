The autocomplete works fine. The only thing you need to do is to get 2n-grams file from http://ngrams.info, and put it in the folder with the setup.py.
Also, since we are using Cython, you have to execute "python setup.py build_ext --inplace".
The usage of the script itself is "python trie_run.py (part of)word".

So far, the runtime is below 2ms.

TODO: 
Add other n-grams, and check if the performance improves.
