The autocomplete works fine. The only thing you need to do is to get 2n-grams file from http://ngrams.info, and put it in the folder with the setup.py.
Also, since we are using Cython, you have to execute "python setup.py build_ext --inplace".
The usage of the script itself is "python trie_run.py (part of)word".

So far, the average runtime is arount 10ms.

TODO:
Add other n-grams, and check if the performance improves.
N-grams doesn't work well for words that aren't infinitive, i.e. "walks". This could be fixed by doing some pre-processing of the word, but the performance will most likely suffer.
