# Muse 2014 LSL

This code provides classes for streaming data from the Muse 2014 headband. It also has classes which allow for real time epoching and anlysis of the EEG data.
Big credit to https://github.com/kaczmarj/rteeg on which this code is largely based. This is a more specific aplication for the 2014 muse headband.

See the test demonstrations folder and run muse_2014_lsl.py for a demonstration. You first need to connect the muse 
through muse.io, and then start the code.
