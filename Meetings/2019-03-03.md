Jen: almost done the final keyboard; need the 'current word being typed' bar
    - question: how are they supposed to close the keyboard?
        - in general: how to integrate into OS?

YanLing: RobotJS is still being buggy; will investigate further

Karl:
    - P300 being developed
        - plan: get Muse streaming properly; then Karl and Lisa will debug ML and Jeremy will debug connection
        - will try to finish for Friday, but seems a bit optimistic
        - tasks:
            - done: streaming from Muse
            - currently:
                - debugging synchronization btn EEG, marker streams
                - debugging timestamp issues btn BlueMuse, other streams
                    - can use dongle instead
                - working on realtime training for ML
    - NLPService:
        - setting up GCP again
        - having trouble with port forwarding
