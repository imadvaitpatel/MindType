Ibrahim:
    - got NLP service updated with front end, however might be a bug

Karl and Jeremy:
    - got p300 ml classifier working
    - using standard classifier, best results with MDM covs
        - MDM cov uses pyRiemann, which has an indexing error
        - will investigate and show error
    - felt like 2 min of data not enough, suggested 4 min
    - need to package parts of p300 together and make API still

Jeremy:
    - convert everything to components in React
        - Sayan will be in touch

Nick:
    - separated start screen and different components, created PR
        - needs to be approved by Ibrahim and YanLing

Saba:
    - doubtful that 6x6 keyboard would work
        - due to predictability
    - might take longer to gather data with full keyboard due to unpredictability
    - will make generic instructions for switcher mode
        - tell Jen after since her task depends on that
        - also collaborating with Nick

Sayan:
    - conditions might have been the best for p300 data collection
        - need to make sure that p300 signal is clean
        - look at other downsampling techniques
            - currently taking every 3rd sample, should look at averaging and other stuff
    - Jeremy doing more React dev, Karl and Lisa do more of p300
    - will finish Electron today
        - figure out how to package everything together afterwards
    - competition coming up real soon, need to finish things
        - __HARD DEADLINE THIS SUNDAY__
