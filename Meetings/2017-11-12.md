## Multi-class:
### Meeting:
    - super resolution for spatial resolution?
        - problem: source localization is hard with fewer electrodes
        - idea: use super resolution to 'mimic' more electrodes (aka increase spatial resolution)
        - progress:
            - looking at RAISR alg
                - will adapt conv kernels to be 3D (2 space dims, 1 time dim)
                    - time dimension will be a fixed window size
                        - later we can have the NN derive a wavelet instead
### TODO:
- Ali: looking into Google RAISR
- Vitaly: looking over super resolution + RAISR
- Sayan:
    - email profs behind Cortical Current Density paper for their data
    - take notes on Cortical Current Density paper
### Done:
- read over Google RAISR, and found code for it on GitHub

## Soft-Eng:
### TODO:
    - make _read_serial_binary function and related functions run faster and more readable 
    - start line-profiling some of the more used functions

### Done:
- 

## NLP
### TODO:
- Train N-gram model with the mass data source.
- Explore more options?
### DONE:
- Tested out the CNN model from link:https://github.com/Kyubyong/word_prediction
- Tried out simple examples for N-grams model.
